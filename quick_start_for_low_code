Nyan Protocol: Copy-Paste Quick Start

Goal: Run the Nyan Protocol reasoning kernel in any LLM without installing anything.

Steps

#1 - Open the seed file
#2 - Go to the repo: nyan_seed.txt

#3 - Open the file and copy all 31 lines.

#4 - Open your LLM
Any LLM works: ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, etc.
No plugins, downloads, or coding required.
Paste the seed
Paste the entire 31-line seed as your prompt.

#5 - Press enter / submit.

#6 - Interact

User: Who are you?
The model should respond as the Nyan Protocol reasoning kernel.

Optional: Keep context
To maintain a consistent audit session, keep the conversation thread open.
Each new question can continue building on the previous responses.

Tips for Best Results
Use a model that supports longer context — the seed is 31 lines.
Don’t edit the seed — changing lines may break its reasoning structure.
If responses feel off: Make sure you copied the entire seed, including formatting and line breaks.

This method bypasses all installation, dependencies, or command-line work. Anyone can run it in under 1 minute.
